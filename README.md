# EMC2
My entry for the 2021 Slimefun Addon Jam, based off of the mod Equivalent Exchange/ProjectE.
It allows transmutation and mass storage of items by converting the into "Quark-Gluon Plasma"

## Equivalents
There is another plugin that integrates with Slimefun: [EquivalencyTech](https://github.com/Sefiraat/EquivalencyTech). It is created by @Sefiraat and is more like ProjectE. If you are looking for a less quantum physicsy feel or your server is less Slimefun-based, I suggest installing that instead.
